ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Lotte, a passionate business economics student with a strong curiosity for coding and its applications in the world of finance and economics.

ðŸ“š Currently pursuing my degree in business economics, I have developed a solid foundation in understanding market dynamics, analyzing economic trends, and making informed business decisions. However, I realized that coding could be a powerful tool to enhance my analytical skills and explore new avenues in my field.

ðŸ’» I've been actively learning C because I was in dire need of a new hobby.

ðŸ“Š My goal is to leverage my expertise in business economics and combine it with my coding skills to develop innovative solutions for complex economic problems. I am particularly interested in exploring the world of financial modeling, algorithmic trading, and data-driven decision-making.

ðŸŒŸ As an avid learner and a believer in the power of collaboration, I am constantly seeking opportunities to work on exciting projects with like-minded individuals. I am eager to contribute my skills, learn from others, and make meaningful contributions to the intersection of business, economics, and coding.
