ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Lotte, a passionate business economics student with a strong curiosity for coding and its applications in the world of finance and economics.

ðŸ“š Currently pursuing my degree in business economics, I have developed a solid foundation in understanding market dynamics, analyzing economic trends, and making informed business decisions. However, I realized that coding could be a powerful tool to enhance my analytical skills and explore new avenues in my field.

ðŸ’» I have embarked on an exciting journey to bridge the gap between economics and technology. With a keen eye for detail and a love for problem-solving, I've been actively learning programming languages such as Python and R, as well as diving into data analysis and visualization techniques.

ðŸ“Š My goal is to leverage my expertise in business economics and combine it with my coding skills to develop innovative solutions for complex economic problems. I am particularly interested in exploring the world of financial modeling, algorithmic trading, and data-driven decision-making.

ðŸŒŸ As an avid learner and a believer in the power of collaboration, I am constantly seeking opportunities to work on exciting projects with like-minded individuals. I am eager to contribute my skills, learn from others, and make meaningful contributions to the intersection of business, economics, and coding.
